# CG-classes
The repository includes a five-stage project created for Computer Graphics' classes at my university. 
Each stage is delivered a standalone solution, written using C# and WinForms.

Every stage expands previous functionalities of the program. Implemented novelties include:
  1. GUI with preview for applying functional (e.g. brightness correction, contrast enhancement) and convolutional (e.g. Gaussian blur, edge detection, custom) filters,
  2. dithering using error diffusion kernels, color quantization using the popularity algorithm.
